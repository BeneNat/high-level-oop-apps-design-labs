# High-Level Object-Oriented Applications Design

This repository contains a collection of laboratory assignments and software projects developed for the **"Designing and creating high-level object-oriented applications"** course. The primary focus of this codebase is to demonstrate advanced C# programming techniques, software architecture principles, and the practical application of object-oriented design patterns.

## Project Overview

The repository is organized into progressive modules, moving from fundamental language features to complex system designs.

* **Lab 1: Inheritance & Hierarchies**: Exploration of access modifiers, constructor chaining, and deep inheritance trees using a Travel Management System context.
* **Lab 2: Polymorphism & Abstraction**: Implementation of abstract base classes, interfaces, and dynamic dispatch handling using a Medieval Castle simulation.
* *(Future labs will be added here)*

## Technologies

* **Language**: C# 12
* **Framework**: .NET 8.0
* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 / JetBrains Rider

## Repository Structure

The solution is structured by laboratory sessions. Each directory typically contains in-class exercises and a larger homework system.
