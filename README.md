# High-Level OOP Applications Design: C# Labs

This repository contains practical laboratory assignments and a final project developed as part of the "Designing and creating high-level object-oriented applications" course. The project focuses on applying fundamental C# concepts, mastering complex inheritance structures, and implementing professional software design patterns.

## Project Context and Objective

The primary goal of this collection is to demonstrate proficiency in advanced OOP principles using the .NET framework, specifically C#. Each module progresses from basic language features toward designing and implementing robust, modular applications that adhere to best practices in software engineering.

## Technologies

* **Language**: C#
* **Framework**: .NET 8.0 (or newer)
* **Tools**: Visual Studio / JetBrains Rider

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized by lab session, with each directory acting as a separate module or project within the main solution file (`HighLevelAppDesign.sln`).

```text
├── Lab1-Inheritance/
│   ├── Lab1-Basics/             # In-class exercise focusing on fundamental concepts
│   └── WorldTour-System/        # Complex homework project (UML-based implementation)
└── ...
```

## Setup and Installation
To set up the development environment, ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```Bash
    git clone https://github.com/BeneNat/high-level-oop-apps-design-labs
    cd high-level-oop-apps-design-labs
    ```

2. Open the Solution: The entire project structure can be loaded by opening the main solution file:

    ```Bash
    HighLevelAppDesign.sln
    ``` 

(via Visual Studio or Rider). All projects will be available for building and running.
